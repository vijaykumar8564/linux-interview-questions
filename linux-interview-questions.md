# 1.what is linux and main features of it?

- Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, which was originally created by Linus Torvalds in 1991.
- It is one of the most prominent examples of free and open-source software collaboration.
- Linux is widely used in servers, embedded systems, and as an operating system for personal computers, including desktops, smartphones, and tablet computers. Here are some of its main features:

## Open Source:
 Linux is distributed under open-source licenses, meaning that anyone can freely use, modify, and distribute it. This fosters collaboration and innovation among developers worldwide.

## Kernel:
 At its core, Linux uses the Linux kernel, which is the operating system's foundation responsible for managing hardware resources, scheduling tasks, and providing essential services to other software running on the system.

## Multiuser:
 Linux supports multiple users accessing the system simultaneously, each with their own user account and permissions. This makes it suitable for use in multi-user environments such as servers.

## Multitasking:
 Linux is capable of running multiple processes concurrently, allowing users to perform various tasks simultaneously without significant degradation in performance.

## Security:
 Linux is known for its robust security features, including user-based permissions, file system encryption, firewall capabilities, and regular security updates. Its security model is well-regarded and has been extensively tested by the open-source community.

## Stability and Reliability:
 Linux systems are known for their stability and reliability, often running for extended periods without requiring a reboot. This makes Linux particularly suitable for use in critical environments such as servers and embedded systems.

## Portability:
 Linux has been ported to a wide range of hardware platforms, from small embedded devices to supercomputers. This portability allows Linux to be used in various computing environments, including desktops, servers, mobile devices, and IoT devices.

## Package Management:
 Linux distributions typically come with package management systems that simplify the installation, removal, and management of software packages. This makes it easy for users to install and update software from a centralized repository.

## Customization:
 Linux offers a high degree of customization, allowing users to tailor their systems to their specific needs and preferences. Users can choose from a wide range of desktop environments, window managers, and software applications to create a personalized computing experience.
